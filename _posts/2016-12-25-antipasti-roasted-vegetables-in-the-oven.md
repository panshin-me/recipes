How to roast any vegetables

Once you&#8217;ve cut your vegetables down into bite-sized pieces, toss them with some good-tasting oil. Use enough to give the vegetables with a slick, glossy coating, but not so much that you have puddles in the bottom of your bowl — a tablespoon or two will usually get the job done. Not only does the oil help the vegetables cook more evenly and crisp up in the oven, but it also adds a rich flavor that makes roasted vegetables irresistible.

I usually use a coconut� oil� or avocado oil. Also, I toss the vegetables with my hands so I can rub the oil into the vegetables and make sure they&#8217;re evenly coated.� Last toss the vegetables with some salt.
