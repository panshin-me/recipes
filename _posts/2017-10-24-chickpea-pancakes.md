      Ingredients
    
    
    
      
        1 cup water or coconut milk
      
      
        1 egg
      
      
        1 banana
      
      
        1 cup chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour
      
      
        1 Tbsp baking powder
      
      
        2 Tbsp arrowroot starch
      
      
        1 tsp cinnamon
      
      
        ghee or coconut oil for frying
      
    
    
    
    
  
  
  
    
      Make It
    
    
    
      
        Place all ingredients into your high speed blender or food processor and mix until smooth.
      
      
        Melt 1 Tbsp of coconut oil or ghee into your pan. Using your ¼ cup or ½ cup measure (whatever size you like best), scoop the batter and pour onto your medium heat skillet.
      
      
        Let cook until you see bubble throughout the pancake, and then flip. Cook for 2-3 minutes on the other side.
      
      
        Serve with your favourite pancake toppings.
