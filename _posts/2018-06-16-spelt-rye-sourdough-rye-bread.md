The day before stir together: 


  500 g spelt flour


  100gr sourdough starter (from rye flour and water)


  250ml ml water


  1 teaspoon of salt. 


  Optional: 1 tbsp of honey or Molasses


Mix in Kenwood Chef for 10 minutes &#8211; it will be rather sticky (especially because of the rye flour) and rather soft. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. This will help to absorb the water properly and � develop the gluten. Knead again for one minute. You will probably note that the consistency has changed and that the dough feels a little bit firmer. But it still will be rather soft.

Line a glass loaf pan with parchment paper. (Sourdough can be a little hard on your pans. That’s why you shouldn’t grease the pan but use some parchment instead.) Transfer the dough to the pan using wet hands and slightly press to shape it a bit. Cover it with a plastic wrap and let sit for a night ( I gave it 12h-14h ) or until the dough rise ⅕ or doubled in size   Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and bake for 45 min-55 min or until looks brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. (Even better if have a meat thermometer – it will finally be useful – you can insert into the loaf. The temperature should be 93°C (200°F).   Tip: so the loaf edges does not come too crispy I put another pan with water on the bottom of the oven. 

Let the loaf cool completely before slicing. You can also wait a whole day to cut this bread, this will improve the flavour.
