### Instructions {.cookbook-title.cookbook-title-instructions}


  
    Preheat oven to 400°(F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.
  
  
    In a large bowl mix together the dry ingredients; flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, sugar.
  
  
    Cut the butter into small cubes then, using two forks or a pastry cutter, quickly work it into the mixture until it resembles a coarse meal. Set aside.
  
  
    In a small bowl whisk together the egg, ricotta cheese, and liquid coconut water. Add to flour and butter mixture and use a fork to stir everything together until just moistened.
  
  
    Add in the chopped cranberries and gently fold them into dough with a spatula.
  
  
    Pour the shaggy dough out onto a clean, lightly floured work surface and shape the dough into a circle. Cut the dough into 6-8 wedges and carefully transfer them to the prepared sheet. Leave an inch or so between each scone as they do spread a little.
  
  
    Lightly brush each scone with an egg wash, then sprinkle the top of each scone with sugar.
  
  
    Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the tops are lightly golden brown. Cool scones on the pan for 10 minutes, then top with glaze or jam.
