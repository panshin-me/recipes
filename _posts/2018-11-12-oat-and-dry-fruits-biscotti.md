**INGREDIENTS**
  
2 cups milled oats (old-fashioned or quick-cooking)
  
1/4 cup of all purpose flour or buckwheat flour (for gluten free version)
  
1 teaspoon of soda in 2 tbl spoon of lemon juice or natural cranberries juice
  
½ teaspoon fine sea salt
  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  
3 eggs
  
⅔ cup chopped pecans or walnuts
  
1 cup of dry fruits ( cranberries, cherries, raisins, currants )
  
½ cup coconut sugar or packed light brown sugar
  
½ cup plain nondairy or dairy milk
  
2 tablespoons virgin coconut oil, melted, or vegetable oil of choice

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Process the oats into a fine flour; transfer to a large bowl and mix with all the dry ingredients; sugar salt and flour.
  
2. Separately whisk the eggs, milk, vanilla, oil, soda and lemon juice
  
3. Add wet mixture into the dry oat mixture, stirring until well-blended.
  
Then add dry fruits and nuts &#8211; mix gently.
  
4.Place dough on large baking sheet with parchment paper, using moistened hands and shape into one or two parallel rectangles.
  
5. Bake in preheated 325°F for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden.
  
6. Cut rectangles slices. I like the biscotti when its crispy outside but a little soft inside.
  
If you like it all crispy, then place again into the oven sliced and bake for 15 minutes or until edges are dark golden.
