Ingredients:

2-3 large apples

2 large eggs, at room temperature

3/4 cup (150g) sugar

3 tablespoons dark rum

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

8 tbs of melted coconut oil or 8 tablespoons (115g) butter, unsalted, melted.

3/4 cup (110g) flour (I used gluten free rice flour)

1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in a little lemon juice

Preparation :

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).

2. Butter an 8- or 9-inch (20-23cm) springform pan and place it on a baking sheet.

3. Peel the apples and dice them into small pieces. Place the pieces on the baking sheet so they cover fully the bottom of pan.

5. In a large bowl, beat the eggs until foamy then whisk in the sugar, then rum and vanilla. Whisk in half of the flour, then gently stir in half of the melted butter & soda

6. Stir in the remaining flour, then the rest of the butter.

7. Fold in the apple cubes until they’re well-coated with the batter and scrape them into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top a little with a spatula.

8. Bake the cake for 50 minute to 1 hour, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool for 5 minutes, then run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake from the pan and carefully remove the sides of the cake pan, making sure no apples are stuck to it.

**Serving**: Serve wedges of the cake just by itself, or with crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream.

**Storage:** The cake will keep for up to three days covered. Since the top is very moist, it’s best to store it under a cake dome or overturned bowl.
