## Ingredients {.heading__h2--gutters.recipe-ingredients__header}

10-12� scones


  
    500gr (2 cups) all-purpose flour
  
  
    50gr� cup sugar
  
  
    1 teaspoon baking powder
  
  
    1/4 teaspoon baking soda (mixed separately with tea spoon of lemon juice)
  
  
    1/2 teaspoon salt
  
  
    6 tablespoons unsalted butter, frozen
  
  
    1/2 cup raisins/� dried cranberries or dried currants
  
  
    1/2 cup sour cream 10%-14%� 
  
  
    1 large egg
  


## Directions {.heading__h2--gutters}


  
    Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
  
  
    In a medium bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda (mixed separately with tea spoon of lemon juice). Add� butter into flour mixture. � &#8211; I used� food processor to � blend everything in to crumbles. But you also can use your fingers to work in to a mixture.� 
  
  
    Then stir in dry fruits.
  
  
    In a small bowl, whisk sour cream and egg until smooth.
  
  
    Using a fork, stir sour cream mixture into flour mixture until large dough clumps form. Use your hands to press the dough against the bowl into a ball. (The dough will be sticky in places, and there may not seem to be enough liquid at first, but as you press, the dough will come together.)

    Place on a lightly floured surface and pat into a circle. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tsp. of sugar. Use a sharp knife to cut into 8 triangles; place on a cookie sheet (preferably lined with parchment paper), about 1 inch apart.
  
  
    Bake until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes and serve warm or at room temperature.
