##### Mama Mila&#8217;s Cafe

9113 Derry Rd W, Milton, ON L9T 7Y9

Small but very pleasant caffe with friendly&nbsp;owners and personal&nbsp;service. It offers simple but yet delicious selection of Polish /&nbsp;Eastern Europe menu, that we like&nbsp;very much. Everything we ordered was tasty, fresh and&nbsp;felt like home made food. &nbsp;Not too salty or too sweet just excellent for kids or adults.

Definitely a nice little spot that we&nbsp;will keep visiting.

##### Uncle Tetsu&#8217;s Japanese Cheesecake

Address: 598 Bay St Toronto,, Toronto, ON M5G 1M5

There is almost always a lineup to get into Uncle Tetsu&#8217;s but I think with good reason.

They offer very moist and enjoyable light cheesecake&nbsp;that in my opinion well worth the $8/10. Its not as heavy in fat and sugar as NY&nbsp;style cheesecakes, way&nbsp;healthier and testier. &nbsp;It so fluffy that it really melts&nbsp;in your mouth.

They sell it fresh and warm immediately from the oven for $10 but if you&nbsp;preferred it cooled they have some they bake in advance and &nbsp;keep in a&nbsp;fridge and you can get it for $8
  
Its good for 4 people.
