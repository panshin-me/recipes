### INGREDIENTS


  
    Crust
  
  
  
    
      1 cup oats or walnuts
    
    
      1 cup raisins
    
    
      2 tablespoons cold-pressed coffee
    
  
  
  
    Ladyfingers
  
  
  
    
      1 cup oats
    
    
      1 cup dates
    
    
      Pinch of salt
    
    
      1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    
    
      2 tablespoons cold-pressed coffee
    
  
  
  
    Vanilla cream
  
  
  
    
      2 cups pine nuts or macadamia nuts
    
    
      2 cups water, as needed
    
    
      1/4 cup liquid coconut oil
    
    
      3 tablespoons coconut nectar
    
    
      1 tablespoon vanilla extract
    
    
      3 teaspoons soy lecithin (optional, but recommended to thicken the mixture)
    
  


### PREPARATION


  
    
      To make the crust: process the oats or walnuts into flour in a food processor. Add the raisins and coffee and process until it forms a ball. Press evenly into the bottom of a lined bread pan. Set in the fridge.
    
    
      To make the ladyfingers: process the oats into flour in a food processor then combine the rest of the ingredients in a food processor until they begin to stick together. Form into rectangular cookies (ladyfingers) that will fit into your baking pan. Dehydrate for 1-2 hours on each side, or use your oven at its lowest temperature.
    
    
      To make the vanilla cream: blend all the ingredients until smooth and thick, like pudding, adding liquid as needed. Spread half this mixture onto your crust, then place your lady fingers close beside each other on top of the vanilla cream. Carefully spread on the rest of the vanilla cream and set in the fridge or freezer for at least 24 hours.
    
    
      When ready to serve: gently take the tiramisu out of the pan, dust with cacao powder, and slice into squares with a sharp knife.
