##### _CRANBERRY CRÈME TARTS_

I found this beautiful vegan tart� by © Emily von Euw from The Rawsome Vegan Cookbook.

Makes four tarts

###### Crust:

_2 cups shredded coconut
  
1 cup dates
  
3 tablespoons cacao powder
  
1 1/2 teaspoons Pranin Organic&#8217;s PureFood Iron_

Cranberry crème:
  
_2 tablespoons chopped beet
  
2 tablespoons melted cacao butter
  
1/4 teaspoon vanilla powder
  
1 500ml can full fat coconut milk
  
1/2 cup dried cranberries
  
1 tablespoon coconut sugar
  
Pinch sea salt_

###### Garnish (optional):

_1 tablespoon black sesame seeds
  
4 sprigs mint leaves
  
Pinch fleur de sel_

To make the crust: grind the coconut shreds into powder in a blender, then add the rest of the ingredients and blend until a moist dough forms. Press into lined tart tins and leave in the fridge.

To make the crème: scoop the thick fat out of the can of coconut milk &#8211; this is what you wanna use for the crème. Blend all the ingredients together until smooth, sweet and pink; adjust according to taste. Pour into your tarts crust, decorate with black sesame seeds, mint leaves and fleur de sel if you want, and leave the fridge overnight. Enjoy!
