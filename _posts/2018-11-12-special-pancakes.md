Ingredients :

  * 2 eggs
  * 1� cup of Ryazhenka ( ряжaнка ) or plain� yoghurt
  * 150 gr Butternut Squash
  * 1 Green Smith Apple
  * Dry cranberries or raisins
  * 1.5 cups all purpose flour
  * 1 tsp of Baking Powder

** I never� add salt and no sugar to my pancakes &#8211;� those are naturally fruity sweet and its nice to have them with sour cream, honey or any jam . Though if you prefer it very sweet just� add 1/4 cup of sugar.

Pure the apples and butternut squash� in food processor.
  
In a large bowl, sift together the eggs with Ryazhenka and pour the fruit mixture and cranberries. Add flour, baking powder and mix everything � with a spatula until smooth.

Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using a spoon. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
