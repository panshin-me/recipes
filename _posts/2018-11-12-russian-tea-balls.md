Ingredients:

  * 1 cup 250gr of unsalted butter
  * 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
  * 120gr of sugar
  * 1 cup of choped walnuts or almonds
  * 2 cups / 500gr of all purpose flour ( for gluten free, I used coconut flour, almond flour or a mix of gluten free flour )

Preparation:

  * Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
  * In a medium bowl, cream butter and vanilla until smooth. Combine the 6 tablespoons confectioners&#8217; sugar and flour; stir into the butter mixture until just blended. Mix in the chopped walnuts. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and place them 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
  * Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. When cool, roll in remaining confectioners&#8217; sugar. I also like to roll mine in the sugar a second time.
