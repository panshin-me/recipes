        For Glaze:
      
    
    
    
      
        1/4 cup lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
      
    
    
    
      
        1 cup confectioners&#8217; sugar, sifted
      
    
  



  
    Preparation
  
  
  
    
      
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease loaf pan, or line with parchment paper.
      
      
        In a� large bowl of a standing mixer, beat butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated.
      
      
        In a separate� bowl, whisk together 1/2 of the sour cream, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla. Then add to the mixture soda and baking powder and combine� all together with the butter , sugar and eggs� &#8211; Whisk all until it smooth
      
      
        On a slow� speed beat� in 1/3 of flour mixture, followed by 1/2 of the left sour cream mixture, and repeat, ending with the last 1/3 of the flour mixture. Be sure to pause the mixer occasionally to scrape down sides of the bowl. Use a spatula to gently fold in cranberries.
      
      
        Spoon batter into prepared loaf pan and bake 55-60 minutes, until top springs back when lightly pressed or a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes in pan, then transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely before icing.
      
      
        To make glaze, whisk together lemon juice and confectioners&#8217; sugar until there are no lumps. Drizzle over cooled cake.
